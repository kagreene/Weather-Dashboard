# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 

This application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve and display the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast for any city that is searched for. Each day's weather report includes the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature in Fahrenheit, the humidity, and the wind speed in MPH. The application also displays the search history to the left of the current city's 5-day forecast to allow the user to easily switch between several city's weather forecasts.
